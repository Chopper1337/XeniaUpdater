# Unofficial Xenia Updater
Small program I made to download, extract and start the latest release of Xenia.

Do not use this every time you start Xenia, only when you wish to update :)

# [Download stable release here](https://github.com/Chopper1337/XeniaUpdater/raw/main/bin/Release/XeniaUpdater.exe)


[Download testing release here](https://github.com/Chopper1337/XeniaUpdater/raw/main/bin/Debug/XeniaUpdater.exe)

Provided you don't run into issues with the testing release, go ahead and use it.

If you run into any issues, message me on Discord "[IRB] Chopper#4291".
Try provide as much info as possible, screenshot of when the issue occurred and a screenshot of the directory the updater was in and so on.

Thanks :)
